                <h1>Welcome to Our Journey!</h1>

                    <p>We are <span>The Terminators</span>, a group of passionate, creative minds who came together at the University of Johannesburg. Over the years, we've collaborated on exciting projects, turning classroom ideas into reality. Dive into our portfolio to explore the work we've done, the skills we've sharpened, and the milestones we've achieved as a team.
                    
                But before we dive into the projects, letâ€™s introduce you to the people behind the work. Each of us has brought our own strengths and perspectives, making every project a true team effort.</p>
